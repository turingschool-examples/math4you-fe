# math4you: Practicing POST Requests 

This application is **almost** complete! It is your job to add in the necessary network request so the app works as expected. 

You'll notice that this codebase was built using React classes. That might seem scary, but don't worry - you got this! Feel free to poke around and look at the existing code. I bet the classes will make more sense than you think!

Your challenge is to fix what's broken - the POST request. The steps are outline below.

Don't overthink this one - the classes don't actually change the work you're doing here. Good luck!

### Set Up
1. Clone down this repo and `cd` into the directory
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Clone down [the backend repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/math4you-api) and `cd` into that directory
5. Run `npm i`
6. Run `node server.js`
7. Spend some time reading through both codebases and clicking around the app (Note: There IS a bug in the app! This is what you are in charge of fixing!)

### Writing the POST
8. Go to the `apiCalls.js` file in the FE repo
9. Complete the function by following the steps outlined in the comments of the function (Note: When you're done, the app should work with NO bugs!)
